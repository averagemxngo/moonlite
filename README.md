## About

### What is Moonlite?

Moonlite is a modern Minecraft hub server solution that is based on DeluxeHub by ItsLewizz, We offer most of the features on DeluxeHub, And we offer all of those features at newer versions of Minecraft.


### Whats the difference?

The main difference between Moonlite and DeluxeHub is that Moonlite uses more modern  technologies, For example. We use MiniMessage, The PaperAPI and updated Java versions. If you want to use this on a older server we recommend using deluxe hub.
